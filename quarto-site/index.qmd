Welcome to my website!

I've spent the past decade working as a research scientist and engineer, primarily with clinical and
biological data. Most recently, I was Head of Machine Learning at
[Delfina](https://www.delfina.com).

I hold a PhD in Computer Science and an ScM in Biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University, a
Bachelor's degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from the University of Oxford, and an
Associate's degree from Deep Springs College.

I currently consult on AI research and applications, with a focus on clincal text and multi-modal
EHR data.

Please feel free to get in touch.
