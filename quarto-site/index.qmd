Welcome to my website!

I've spent the past decade working as a research scientist and engineer, primarily with clinical and
biological data. I've worked as a researcher in a cancer biology lab and as the head of machine
learning at a maternal health company. I currently work on machine learning for cancer care at
Flatiron Health.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science and an ScM in Biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins University, a
Bachelor's degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from the University of Oxford, and an
Associate's degree from Deep Springs College.

Please feel free to get in touch.
