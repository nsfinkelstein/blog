Welcome to my website!

I've spent the past decade working as a research scientist and engineer, primarily with clinical and
biological data. Most recently, I was Head of Machine Learning at Delfina. In April, I'll join the
machine learning team at Flatiron Health.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science and an ScM in Biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins University, a
Bachelor's degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from the University of Oxford, and an
Associate's degree from Deep Springs College.

Please feel free to get in touch.
