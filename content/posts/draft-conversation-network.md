What if there were a social network based on the idea of a "conversation"? The conversation would be
a series of comments in a tree structure, with each comment being in response to its parent. When
navigating the tree, the user could scroll horizontally to see sibiling comments, or vertically to
see parents / descendents. All else being equally, the user is shown a comment according to some
explore / exploit strategy indicating its quality. Users would not be able to follow other users, to
try to prevent incentives for marketing, self-promotion, and clout-building, but would be able to
follow _conversations_, which would typically be quite long-lived.

A conversation could either be over the whole social network, in which case groups are effectively
decided by who participates in which conversations, or they could be only open to sub groups, in
which case a group could have multiple conversations.
